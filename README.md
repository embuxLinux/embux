Embux is a lightweight Linux distro for embedded devices. It's so light, it makes feathers look heavy. It's perfect for those
who want to tinker with their gadgets without sacrificing performance or stability.

## Etymology

Embux stands for **Em**bedded **Bu**syBo**x**. This implies the BusyBox userland is built into the system. It also sounds like
a cute animal, which is a bonus.

## Features

* Compatible with Raspberry Pis as well as traditional x86 PCs. You can run Embux on anything from a tiny computer to a toaster
  (not recommended).
* Uses a homemade init system called `embuxctl`. It's simple, fast, and easy to use. No systemd bloat here.
* Easy installation with the embux CLI for your raspberry pis and old Windows CE setups. Just type `embux install` and watch the magic
  happen.

## FAQ

This will probably get skinny. Read it on the wiki.
