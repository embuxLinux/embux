# Embux
Embux is a lightweight Linux distro for embedded devices built on the Linux from Scratch project.

## Etymology
Embux stands for **Em**bedded **Bu**syBo**x**. This implies the BusyBox userland is built into the system.

## Features
* Compatible with Raspberry Pis as well as traditional x86 PCs.
* Uses a homemade init system called `embuxctl`.
* Easy installation with the embux CLI for your raspberry pis and old Windows CE setups.

## License
* All files under the `kernel` and `busybox` directories are under the GPL 2.0 license as they are mirrors of projects under those licenses.
* All other files are under the GPL 3.0 license or later.
