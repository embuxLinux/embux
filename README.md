# Embux

Embux is a lightweight Linux distro for embedded devices.

## Etymology

Embux stands for **Em**bedded **Bu**syBo**x**. This implies the BusyBox userland is built into the system.

## Features

* Compatible with Raspberry Pis as well as traditional x86 PCs.
* Uses a homemade init system called `embuxctl`.
* Easy installation with the embux CLI for your raspberry pis and old Windows CE setups.

## FAQ

This will probably get skinny. Read it on the wiki.
